# MCES_Library
This library contains a set of functions to model a multi-carrier energy system at the household level. It includes the estimation of a the thermal load (heat loss through windows, roof, walls, ventilation and infiltration), as well as a rule-based control for a battery storage system, a heat pump, a PVT, and a thermal storage system.

Details of the mathematical description can be found in: Alpízar-Castillo, J., Ramírez-Elizondo, L. M., & Bauer, P. (2024). Modelling and evaluating different multi-carrier energy system configurations for a Dutch house. Applied Energy, 364, 123197. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.123197
